Victims approaching BHAROSA have unhindered access to all the support services that they need to overcome their abusive and oppressive circumstances and lead a joyful life thereafter.</p>

            <p>Anyone knocking on the doors of BHAROSA will have immediate access to specialized services. Assistance is provided in an integrated manner through a slew of Police, Medical, Legal and prosecution services apart from Psychotherapeutic Counseling.
